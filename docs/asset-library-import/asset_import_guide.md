# Mastering the Asset Library in Meta Horizon Worlds

Welcome to our guide on using the Asset Library in Meta Horizon Worlds! A rich and vibrant world is built upon the assets it contains. This tutorial will walk you through finding, importing, and managing assets to bring your creative vision to life.

## Understanding the Asset Library

The Asset Library is your gateway to a vast collection of ready-made assets, including:

*   **Shapes & Gizmos:** Basic building blocks and interactive elements.
*   **Materials:** Textures and surfaces to style your objects.
*   **Sounds:** Audio clips to create an immersive atmosphere.
*   **Models:** Pre-built 3D objects to populate your world.

You can access the Asset Library directly from the Creator Menu in VR or through the Desktop Editor.

## Importing Your Own 3D Models

Meta Horizon Worlds supports importing custom 3D models, allowing for truly unique creations.

### Supported Formats

The primary supported formats for 3D models are `.gltf` and `.glb`. If you have models in other formats like `.fbx` or `.obj`, you'll need to convert them first using a tool like Blender.

### Step-by-Step Import Process

1.  **Open the Desktop Editor:** For the most streamlined import process, it's recommended to use the desktop editor.
2.  **Navigate to Your Assets:** In the Asset Library tab, select "My Assets."
3.  **Add a New Asset:** Click the "Add New" button and choose "3D Model."
4.  **Select Your Files:** A dialog will appear, allowing you to choose the model files from your computer. Select the `.glb` or `.gltf` file you wish to import.
5.  **Resolve Issues:** The importer will check your model for any potential issues. If any are found, you'll be prompted to resolve them.
6.  **Import:** Once everything is ready, click "Import." Your model will be processed and added to your personal asset library.

## Using Your Personal Asset Library

Your imported assets are stored in your Personal Asset Library, which can be accessed from the "My Assets" section of the Asset Library. From here, you can:

*   **View Asset Details:** Click on an asset card to see its details, including its name, description, and any associated errors or warnings.
*   **Edit Asset Information:** You can edit the name and description of your assets to keep them organized.
*   **Spawn Assets:** To add an asset to your world, you can either right-click and select "Place" or simply drag and drop it from the asset library into your world.

## Best Practices for Asset Management

*   **Optimize Your Models:** Before importing, make sure your 3D models are optimized for performance. High-polygon models can impact the performance of your world.
*   **Use Descriptive Names:** Give your assets clear and descriptive names to make them easy to find later.
*   **Organize Your Library:** While Horizon Worlds doesn't currently support folders in the personal asset library, using a consistent naming convention can help you keep your assets organized.

By mastering the Asset Library and the import process, you can create more complex, detailed, and engaging worlds for others to enjoy. Happy building!
