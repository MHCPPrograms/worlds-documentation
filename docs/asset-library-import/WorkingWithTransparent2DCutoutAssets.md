## Introduction

<!-- This section should describe what this document is going to cover. Try to provide some background and motivation as to why a creator would want to read your document. -->

This tutorial walks you through a simple workflow for importing 2D cutout assets with transparent backgrounds into Horizon Worlds using the Masked method. As a case study, we’ll demonstrate the process by creating 2D aliens and other design elements.

### Prerequisites and Expectations

<!-- This section should indicate any expectations you have of your readers, such as other materials or concepts they should already be familiar with in order to get the most out of your document. -->

Basic familiarity with Adobe Photoshop (or Canva), Blender, and the Horizon Worlds Desktop Editor.


### Document Organization

<!-- This s an optional section, but possibly useful if your document has unusual document structure, or needs a table of contents with internal links because it is very long. 

Note that github automatically creates a clickable Outline from your section headings. Make sure you properly 'nest' your headings by using ##, ###, ####, #####, etc for sub sections so that the outline has a good hierarchy and makes navigating your document easier. I recommend only using # for the initial title, as the font for H1 renders very large. -->

This document has three main parts, covering texture prep, model prep and importing. Additionally there is a reference section at the end.

## Why use 2D cutout assets?
Use cutouts for background scenery, distant crowd characters, props, signs, UI elements, and decorative layers to save polygon/scene budget. Cutout assets are a cost-effective way to enrich your world. They’re perfect for building visually rich environments, enhancing 3D assets, and adding props or background characters—all without significantly impacting performance in your Horizon Worlds creations.

## Why the Masked method?
Using the Masked method for cutout assets with transparent backgrounds dramatically reduces world capacity compared with the Transparent or Blend methods. Transparency is far more demanding for Horizon Worlds’ rendering engine: whenever semi-transparent elements are processed, performance costs increase. Whenever possible, use masked cutouts instead of semi-transparent assets to optimize performance.

Reserve semi-transparent materials (Transparent or Blend methods) only when soft edges or translucency are essential; otherwise use hard-cut cut-outs (Masked method) for better performance. The Masked method will not work well on assets with soft (blurry) edges.

## Preparing Your Texture in Adobe Photoshop

1. Create a new document at 2048 × 2048 px (2K). Square textures are standard and supported sizes include 1024×1024, 2048×2048, 4096×4096 - stick to those where possible.
2. Place or paste your artwork (alien, prop, etc.) into the document.
3. Remove the background so only the visible art remains. Use the: “Remove background” AI tool to remove the background with only one click.

4. Export a transparent PNG and name it exactly: MATERIAL_BA.png.
   - File → Export → Export As…
   - Format: PNG
   - Transparency: Checked
   - Export

## Preparing Your Textured Model in Blender

1. Start a new Blender file and save it (e.g., Alienfriends.blend).
2. Delete default objects you don't need (camera, light) for a clean scene.
3. Add a plane: Shift + A → Mesh → Plane. This plane will be your 2D cut-out mesh.
4. Create a new material and name it exactly: MATERIAL_MASKED 
PLEASE NOTE: The exact name is important for consistent workflow.
   - Material Properties → New → rename to: MATERIAL_MASKED

5. Open the Shader Editor:
   - Add an Image Texture node and load MATERIAL_BA.png.
   - Connect Image Color → Principled BSDF Base Color.
6. Confirm the image displays correctly in the viewport (Material Preview or Rendered).

7. Check UVs:
   - Open UV Editor and ensure the plane’s UV covers the full texture area and aligns with your artwork.
8. If you have multiple cut-outs, duplicate the plane (Shift + D) and edit each copy in Edit Mode to fit different parts of the texture or to have different scales.
9. Apply transforms before export:
   - In Object Mode select all relevant objects → Ctrl/Cmd + A → Apply All Transforms.
   - Verify each object’s Scale reads 1.0,1.0,1.0 and rotation/location are applied as needed.
10. Export as FBX:
    - Select only the mesh(es) to export.
    - File → Export → FBX (.fbx)
    - Check “Selected Objects”
    - Under Object Types: enable only: Mesh
    - Save with a descriptive name (example: Alien.fbx)

## Importing Your Model to Horizon Worlds

1. Open Horizon Worlds Desktop Editor → Asset Library → My Assets.
2. Click Add New → 3D Model.
3. In the Import Model(s) window click “+ Choose files on your device” and select:
   -  MATERIAL_BA.png 
   -  Alien.fbx  (or your exported FBX)

5. Click Import and wait for Horizon Worlds to process the asset. Processing may take a moment; if it fails, try re-exporting or a different browser. Make sure: “Preserve offset pivots” is OFF.
6. Once processing completes you can place the cut-out in your world and test collision, lighting, and scale.

## ADVANCED CONCEPTS:  Blend vs Transparent vs Masked

It’s worth noting that Horizon supports multiple methods of handling transparency, each with its own advantages and limitations:

### Blended (Unlit) Materials
	•	Do not receive or cast lighting or shading.
	•	Have no specular or reflection properties.
	•	The material name in the FBX must end with _Blend.

### Transparent Materials
	•	Allow light to pass through.
	•	Use a specular channel to control both specular and reflection levels.
	•	Support two textures, which provide finer control over PBR properties.
	•	The material name in the FBX must end with _Transparent.

### Masked Materials
	•	Control how two textures mix together.
	•	Respond to specular and roughness, but are always fully rough (roughness = 1).
	•	The alpha channel of the texture defines opacity (white = opaque, black = transparent).
	•	Alpha cutout occurs at 0.5, consistent with GLTF 2.0 and Unity defaults.
	•	The material name in the FBX must end with _Masked.
