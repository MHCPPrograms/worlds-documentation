Here is the way I managed to get Booleans into Meta Horizon Worlds:
 
1. **Apply all Modifiers**  
   Make sure every Boolean (and other modifiers) is applied before export.
 
2. **Join the Geometry**  
   Select and join your meshes so they become one connected object.
 
3. **Check the Normals**  
   Verify that none of the Normals are flipped. Recalculate them if necessary.
 
4. **Convert to Triangles**  
   From the Faces of your mesh, create Triangles. This ensures the mesh displays correctly in Horizon.
