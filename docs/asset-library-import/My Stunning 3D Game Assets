# From Concept Art to Stunning 3D Game Assets

# Introduction

In the realm of game development and digital content creation, transforming a creative idea into a functional and visually striking 3D asset is a critical skill that can elevate your projects to a professional level. This tutorial will guide you step-by-step through the entire process of creating a 3D weapon, starting from a simple concept sketch to its final integration into a Horizon World Desktop Editor. Whether you're a beginner in 3D modeling or an experienced creator looking to streamline your workflow, you'll learn practical techniques and accessible tools to bring your visions to life. We’ll use industry-standard software like Blender for modeling, texturing and paiting and finally import the result into the Horizon World Desktop Editor, Meta’s platform for building immersive metaverse experiences. Get ready to unleash your creativity and craft assets that not only look stunning but are also optimized for games and virtual environments.

This repository was created to show a tutorial on how to create a 3D model in Blender from a reference image, to which texture painting is applied manually. It can then be imported into the Horizon World Desktop Editor in FBX format to be used as part of any virtual world you want to develop. 

# Requirements
* Blender 2.93
* Horizon World Desktop Editor
* Reference image that will be used to create our 3D model.

# TIPS

Consider that working with Blender can be a challenging task, however, let me tell you a trick to help you progress more quickly in creating your own 3D model: one hand on the keyboard and one hand on the mouse. This is because Blender works with keyboard shortcuts to implement different techniques that will be used extensively throughout this tutorial. You'll find that some shortcuts are applied repeatedly, allowing you to gradually memorize them and feel more comfortable with the work environment.

## Default Workspaces

Blender’s default startup shows the “Layout” workspace in the main area. This workspace is a general workspace to preview your scene and contains the following Editors:

* 3D Viewport on top left.
* Outliner on top right.
* Properties on bottom right.
* Timeline on bottom left.

Once we're in Blender, we find the image we'll use as a reference and drag it into Blender's workspace. It will look like this:

![](docs/asset-library-import/ImportingImageReference.png)

Once we have our reference image loaded in Blender, we need to adjust our camera view so that we have our reference in orthogonal projection. Because the way it appears referenced when we move the mouse scroll button, we can lose sight of the reference image. To avoid this, we must do the following: **Alt + G**. Our reference image will look like this:

![](docs/asset-library-import/RelocatingImageBackground.png)

Now that you have the reference image positioned, we need to put it in a two-dimensional projection view. To do this, go to the Transform panel on the right and look for the **Rotation** option. You'll notice some values ​​appear, and we'll set them to **0**.

![](docs/asset-library-import/Reposition.png)

![](docs/asset-library-import/RotationReference.png)

Then having the previous image we press the key combination **R + X + 90** (this means that we want to rotate the image 90 degrees on the X axis) and we will obtain the following result.

![](docs/asset-library-import/FinalRotationReference.png)

Once we have the previous result, we press the number 1 on our numpad to center our orthographic perspective and then go to **Wireframe mode**, which allows us to change our cube that appears in the image from being visibly solid to having it in Wireframe form. To do this, we go to the top of our work window and click on the icon in the following image.

![](docs/asset-library-import/WireframeMode.png)

And we can see how the cube changes. This step allows us to model any 3D object from a reference image we have as a background. Then, we press **S** (to scale the cube) and then press **G** (to grab the cube) and position it as shown in the following image:

![](docs/asset-library-import/ChangingCube.png)

Next, press **Tab** to enter cube editing mode and move the vertices of our cube as close as possible to each part of our model. For this step, it's important to select both vertices of our cube, as shown in the following image. To select both vertices, left-click with the mouse, and the cursor will change to the following.

![](docs/asset-library-import/CubeEdition.png)

Once we have positioned all our vertices, we will have the following result.

![](docs/asset-library-import/FirstApproach.png)

As you can see, we need more vertices to complete our entire model. So, we'll use the **Ctrl + R** key combination and position ourselves over our cube. We'll notice a new cut has been added, which we can place wherever we see fit to help us cover our entire model. We repeat this step three times, and the final result will be as follows.

### TIPS: If after pressing **Ctrl + R** you move the mouse scroll you can add more cuts automatically without doing the procedure manually.

![](docs/asset-library-import/AddingMoreVertices.png)

Next, we need to reposition the new vertices created in the previous step. To do this, while still in edit mode, press the **Tab key** to select each of the new vertices (both vertices must be selected for each new cut) and reposition them by pressing the **G key**, using our image background as a reference. The result should be as follows.

![](docs/asset-library-import/RepositionVertices.png)

### TIP: To reposition our working view if we've moved our model with the mouse's scroll key, simply press the 1 key on the numpad to return to our working position.

Now we'll proceed to cover the entire piece. To do this, we'll switch to solid mode and, while in edit mode, select the front face. Once we have it selected, press the **E key** (which means we're extruding outwards in this case) and then press **G** to reposition the vertices on the model. We'll repeat this step three times, and the result should be as follows.

### TIP: If you want to reposition vertices without adding new ones to the model, select the vertices first, then press G twice to place them where you think they'll fit over your model. Finally, press Enter again. You'll see how the cursor changes in Blender.

Now we need to adjust how wide we want our model to be. To make it smaller, we'll scale it by pressing **S + Y** (scale along the Y axis only). The result should be as follows. Then, we'll press 1 again on the numpad to add new meshes to cover other parts of the model.

![](docs/asset-library-import/PerspectiveYAxis.png)

If you've made it this far into the tutorial, Congratulations...!!! The way we've worked in this first part is how we'll cover the rest of the tutorial.
Now, let's add more graphic primitives to model the rest of the parts. In this second part, we'll add cylinders to cover the top of our 3D model. Press Tab to enter object mode, then press 1 on our numpad to change the view. Press **Shift + A** to go to the **Mesh option**, then look for **Cylinder**.

![](docs/asset-library-import/MoreElements.png)

Now we need to change the number of vertices our cylinder will have. To do this, go to the **Add Cylinder** tab (located in the lower left corner of our workspace) and change the number **from 32 vertices to 12 vertices**. As shown in the following image.

![](docs/asset-library-import/AddCylinder.png)

And then we scale it by pressing the **S key** and then we rotate it on the Y axis using the key combination **R + Y + 90** and then we scale it using **S + X** (scale on the X axis) until it covers the entire cylindrical part of our model. The result should be the following.

![](docs/asset-library-import/RotatingCylinder.png)

Now we're going to change the view so we can adjust the cylinder to our reference image. To do this, we'll press the **Toggle X-ray option**, which basically allows us to see our reference for better repositioning of our cylinder.

![](docs/asset-library-import/ToggleXRay.png)

Once we have it activated, we then add a new cut with the combination **Crtl + R** twice in our cylinder and the result would be the following.

![](docs/asset-library-import/AddingCut.png)

As we can see in the image, we have two "rings" that are part of the piece we're modeling. So, let's add four more new cuts using the Ctrl + R combination, and the final result will be as follows:

![](docs/asset-library-import/AddingMoreCutCylinder.png)

Now we will proceed to create the front part of our 3D model. First we will select all the end vertices of our cylinder that are located on the right. Then, we will repeat the **E + S** combination several times to cover each one of the front part. First we select **E** to extrude and then press **S** to scale the vertices and with the mouse we move the cursor outwards. Then we press **E + X** again (we extrude and move along the X axis) until we reach the end of the first shape in the reference image. Then we repeat the previous step again to cover the second shape. And when we are at the end, we just press **E + X** we reach the end and then with the **S key** we locate the vertices. And finally we just apply **E + X** to have the final edge of our model. The final result will be the following:

![](docs/asset-library-import/ExtrudingParts.png)

Great that you've finished this second part of the modeling. Now let's move on to the telescopic sight for our weapon. And the best part is that we can repeat some of the steps we used earlier. Next, let's place a cylinder (**Shift + A, select the Mesh option, then select Cylinder**) and rotate it 90 degrees along the Y axis. Then, scale the model and apply some cuts. The first result we'll get is the following:

![](docs/asset-library-import/Telescopic.png)

For the rear of the scope, we'll select all the vertices at the end. Then we'll proceed with the I combination to move the vertices inwards. Then we press **E** to extrude along the **X** axis, then we press **E + S** again until we reach the end of our scope.

![](docs/asset-library-import/MoreTelescopic.png)

Now we're going to model the back of our reference image. We need to move the cursor to the center of our workspace. To do this, we'll use the **Shift + Right Click** key combination in the area where we want to add a new cube. Then, we'll use the **Shift + A** key combination, select Mesh, and look for the Cube option. Next, we'll locate the cube and scale it so that it covers the back. To do this, we'll need to extrude it again with E and then move it over our reference image.

![](docs/asset-library-import/BackPiece.png)

### TIP: To select multiple vertices of the same face without selecting other vertices, you can press the C key and when you have all the vertices selected, just press the Esc key.

Then we proceed to finish fine-tuning the details of our telescopic sight that is in the model. For this, we will select the first cut with the key combination **Shift + Left Click** and observe how the entire area is selected. Then we apply **E + S + Shift + X** (this allows us to extrude and scale only on the X axis so that other parts of the model are not altered). We repeat this step for the other cut of our model that we have present in the reference image. It is important to note that we have to be in Edit Mode. Then for the part of the lens that is in the sight, we select all the vertices then press **I** (Insert), then extrude outwards and then apply **I** (Insert) again. We also repeat the process for the final part of the telescopic sight. With the peculiarity that we have to extrude inwards

![](docs/asset-library-import/FinishingSeveralPieces.png)

Now we'll complete the rest of our model's piece above the trigger. To do this, we'll select the last vertices located to the right of the piece we were working on previously and repeat the extrusion, scaling, and positioning processes on our reference image. The result will be as follows:

![](docs/asset-library-import/BackPieceandBody.png)

For the area where the trigger is, we'll add two cubes to cover the entire area. The final result will be as follows.

![](docs/asset-library-import/Trigger.png)

Now for the hammer part that activates once the trigger is pressed, we'll use another cube. The procedure for this piece is basically the same as the one we used previously. So the final result would be as follows.

![](docs/asset-library-import/Hammer.png)

If we review our model after completing all these steps, we can see that we will have something like the following.

![](docs/asset-library-import/ReviewofModel.png)

Now we're going to refine the model a little further. To do this, we're going to use a modifier called Mirror. Basically, what it does is copy everything modified on one side of the model exactly to the other side, providing a kind of symmetry that allows us to have a uniform model. We select the first piece we modeled at the beginning of this tutorial and apply the Mirror modifier to it by selecting the Y axis. Next, we need to implement a cut along the model because we're going to remove one side so the modifier can work without any problems.

![](docs/asset-library-import/MirrorModifier.png)

The side we have selected is the one left after removing the other faces. What you see next to it is the Mirror modifier implemented. **Don't forget to select the "Clipping" option within the modifier so that when you move the vertices, they don't separate**.

![](docs/asset-library-import/Clipping.png)

For the backend, we're going to implement a different method than the one we used previously. So, we'll go to the Edit option, then go to Preferences and the Add-ons tab. Enter the word Auto in the search bar and select the Mesh Auto Mirror option with a check mark. This will help us speed up the process of applying the Mirror modification. Then, we'll position ourselves between the two windows where the primitives we're adding to our project are located and the window of our work area until we get the vertical menu. We'll look for the Edit option and enter the values ​​that appear in the image. Finally, we'll click on the AutoMirror option. To enable this side menu, we can press the N key on the keyboard.

![](docs/asset-library-import/Addon.png)

And to check the changes in our model, something like this should appear.

![](docs/asset-library-import/CheckAddon.png)

Now we're going to avoid overlapping vertices in our model. To do this, we'll need to remove certain parts that aren't necessary or visible. The **Knife tool** (pressing the K key) will help us with this. For example, we'll remove the faces of the part that houses the trigger guard and another element of the trigger, as shown in the following image:

![](docs/asset-library-import/KnifeTool.png)
