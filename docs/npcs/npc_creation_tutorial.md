# Creating and Scripting NPCs in Meta Horizon Worlds

Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are a fantastic way to make your world feel more dynamic and alive. From friendly guides to challenging enemies, NPCs can add a new layer of interactivity to your creations. This guide will walk you through the basics of creating and scripting NPCs in Meta Horizon Worlds.

## What is an NPC?

An NPC is any character in your world that is not controlled by a player. They are controlled by the computer, following a set of instructions that you define. NPCs can be as simple as a character that stands in one place and delivers a line of dialogue, or as complex as a patrolling enemy that chases players on sight.

## Creating Your First NPC

Creating an NPC starts with creating an asset. You can use a pre-made character from the Asset Library or create your own custom character and import it.

Once you have your character model, you can turn it into an NPC using the **NPC asset tools** in the Desktop Editor. These tools allow you to define the basic properties of your NPC, such as its name, appearance, and movement speed.

## Bringing Your NPC to Life with AI

The true power of NPCs comes from the ability to give them artificial intelligence (AI). Meta Horizon Worlds offers a range of tools to help you create intelligent and interactive NPCs.

### Generative AI NPCs

One of the most exciting features is the ability to create **generative AI NPCs**. These are NPCs that are powered by large language models (LLMs), allowing them to engage in natural and dynamic conversations with players. Players can speak to these NPCs, and the NPCs will respond in a way that is consistent with their character and the context of the conversation.

### Scripting NPC Behavior

For more direct control over your NPCs, you can use **TypeScript** to script their behavior. With scripting, you can:

*   **Define Movement Paths:** Make your NPCs patrol a specific area, move between waypoints, or follow a set path.
*   **Create Interactive Dialogue:** Create branching dialogue trees that allow players to have conversations with your NPCs.
*   **Program Complex Behaviors:** Create NPCs that react to players, follow them, or even engage in combat.

## Best Practices for NPC Design

*   **Start Simple:** If you're new to creating NPCs, start with a simple character that has a limited set of behaviors. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually add more complexity.
*   **Think About Purpose:** What is the purpose of your NPC? Is it to provide information, to be an obstacle, or to add to the atmosphere? Having a clear purpose will help you design a more effective NPC.
*   **Test and Iterate:** Once you've created your NPC, test it thoroughly. Does it behave as you expect? Is it fun to interact with? Don't be afraid to go back and make changes based on your testing.

NPCs can be a powerful tool for creating engaging and immersive worlds. With the tools available in Meta Horizon Worlds, you have everything you need to bring your characters to life.
