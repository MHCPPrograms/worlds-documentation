### Consumables

Consumables are single-use items that players can activate immediately or save for later. Once consumed, they must be purchased again to use. These are perfect for power-ups, hints, or temporary boosts.

#### Example Consumables in Horizon Worlds

## Economics Strategy

Designing a successful economy in Horizon Worlds isn‚Äôt just about selling items‚Äîit‚Äôs about understanding player behavior, creating value, and building trust. Here‚Äôs how to do it right:

### 1. Freshness: Launch Monthly IWPs
Keep your world feeling alive by releasing new items regularly. This creates anticipation and gives returning players something fresh to explore. For example, a seasonal clothing or limited-edition skin tied to a Halloween can drive re-engagement.

### 2. Mix: Offer a Variety of IWPs
Don‚Äôt rely on one type of item. Mix items that help the player achieve the same set of goals. This gives players options and lets them choose how they want to engage. A enchanted battle game might sell both ‚ÄúStar Shurikens‚Äù (consumables) and ‚ÄúMoonlit Saber‚Äù (durables) as weapons.

### 3. Relevancy: Tie IWPs to Core Gameplay
Make sure your items feel meaningful. A ‚ÄúTime Saver Boost‚Äù that helps players skip a level is more valuable than a random cosmetic in a puzzle game. The best IWPs solve a problem or enhance the experience.

## Pricing Strategy

Horizon Worlds uses **Meta Credits**, ranging from 25 to 2,000 credits. Here‚Äôs how to price smart:

- **Different Prices for Everyone:** Sell items at a range of prices (low, medium, and high) so there's something for every budget.
- **Easy First Buys:** Offer cheap items to help new players feel comfortable with making their first purchase.
- **Making Other Items Look like a Good Deal:** Have a few very expensive items for sale. This makes the medium-priced items seem like a better value.
- **Deals for Leftover Coins:** Create special packages or bundles to help players use up the small amount of game coins they have left.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Overpricing**: New users won‚Äôt spend 500 credits on an item they don‚Äôt understand. Start small.  
- **Under-delivering**: If your IWP doesn‚Äôt match its description or value, players won‚Äôt trust future purchases.  
- **Neglecting Updates**: A stale economy leads to drop-off. Keep your store fresh and relevant.  
- **Ignoring Analytics**: Track what sells and what doesn‚Äôt. Use that data to refine your strategy.
