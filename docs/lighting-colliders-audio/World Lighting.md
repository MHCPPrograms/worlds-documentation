# Horizon Worlds Lighting Tutorial

## Introduction

Lighting in Horizon Worlds is how you control the brightness, color, and mood of your virtual space. It‚Äôs like painting with light‚Äîhelping players feel something when they enter your world.
In Horizon Worlds, lighting is created using special tools called **gizmos**. These gizmos let you add sunlight, lamps, flashlights, and even lights that change when players interact with them.

## 2. Static Light Gizmo ‚Äì Lighting That Stays the Same

Static lights are great for areas that don‚Äôt need to change‚Äîlike a lamp in a room or sunlight in a park.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Use It
- Go to the **Build menu**, search for **Static Light Gizmo**, and drag it into your world.
- Click on it to open the settings.

<details>
  <summary><strong>üîç Properties</strong></summary>

  <br>

  ![Static Gizmo](./assets/StaticLight.png)

  - **Enabled**: Turns the light on or off.
  - **Shape**: Choose the form of the light. There are **four shapes**:
    - **Cuboid**: A box-shaped light that shines evenly in all directions.
    - **Ellipsoid**: A soft, round light that glows gently without sharp edges.
    - **Disk**: A flat, circular light that shines in one direction‚Äîlike a spotlight.
    - **Rectangle**: A wide, flat light that also shines directionally‚Äîgreat for walls or ceilings.
  - **Color**: Pick the color of your light.

## 3. Dynamic Light Gizmo ‚Äì Lights That Move or React

Dynamic lights can change during gameplay. You can attach them to objects or use scripts to turn them on and off.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Use It
- Go to the **Build menu**, search for **Dynamic Light Gizmo**, and drag it into your world.
- Click on it to open the settings.

<details>
  <summary><strong>üîç Properties</strong></summary>

  <br>

  ![Dynamic Gizmo](./assets/DynamicLight.png)

  - **Enabled**: Activates the light in your scene.
  - **Light Type**: Set to **Spot** or **Point**.
  - **Color**: Uses RGB values to define the light‚Äôs hue.
  - **Intensity**: Controls the brightness of the light.
  - **Falloff Distance**: Determines how far the light travels before fading out.
  - **Spread**: Defines the angle of the spotlight cone.

## Light Interactions with Scripts
This code sample shows how a dynamic light can be turned off and on during gameplay.

  ![Flashlight Script](./assets/LightChange.png)

  **Parameters**  
  - **torch**: The parent object of the light source  
  - **lightbulb**: The dynamic light

</details>

```typescript
import * as hz from 'horizon/core';

class flashlight extends hz.Component<typeof flashlight> {
  static propsDefinition = {
    torch: { type: hz.PropTypes.Entity },        // Grabbable torch object
    lightbulb: { type: hz.PropTypes.Entity }     // DynamicLightGizmo
  };

  private onOff: boolean = false;                // Tracks light state
  private isGrabbed: boolean = false;            // Tracks grab state

  start() {
    // When torch is grabbed
    this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.props.torch!, hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnGrabStart, () => {
      this.isGrabbed = true;
      this.updateLight();
    });

    // When torch is released
    this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.props.torch!, hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnGrabEnd, () => {
      this.isGrabbed = false;
      this.updateLight();
    });

    // When index trigger is pressed
    this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.props.torch!, hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnIndexTriggerDown, () => {
      if (this.isGrabbed) {
        this.onOff = !this.onOff;
        this.updateLight();
      }
    });

    // Ensure light starts off
    this.updateLight();
  }

  private updateLight() {
    const light = this.props.lightbulb?.as(hz.DynamicLightGizmo);
    if (!light) return;
    light.enabled.set(this.isGrabbed && this.onOff);
  }
}

hz.Component.register(flashlight);
```

## Summary

Lighting is one of the easiest ways to make your Horizon World feel special. Start with the **Environment Gizmo** to set the mood, use **Static Lights** for steady glow, and add **Dynamic Lights** for fun effects and interaction.
