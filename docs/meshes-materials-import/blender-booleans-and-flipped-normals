##My Experience with Booleans in Blender and Meta Horizon Worlds

A few weeks ago I ran into a problem:  
I had built something in **Blender** using my beloved **Booleans** â€” but when I tried to import it into the **Meta Horizon Desktop Editor**, the Boolean appeared closed.  
Even though I had already applied the Modifier, the mesh didnâ€™t show up correctly in my world.

Here is the way I managed to get Booleans into Meta Horizon Worlds:

1. **Apply all Modifiers**  
   Make sure every Boolean (and other modifiers) is applied before export.

2. **Join the Geometry**  
   Select and join your meshes so they become one connected object.

3. **Check the Normals**  
   Verify that none of the Normals are flipped. Recalculate them if necessary.

4. **Convert to Triangles**  
   From the Faces of your mesh, create Triangles. This ensures the mesh displays correctly in Horizon.
