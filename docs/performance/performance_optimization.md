# Optimizing Your World for Performance in Meta Horizon Worlds

A smooth and responsive world is a joy to experience. As a creator, it's important to keep performance in mind throughout the development process. This guide will provide you with tips and tricks for optimizing your world's performance in Meta Horizon Worlds.

## Why is Performance Important?

Performance is key to providing a good user experience. A world that runs poorly can cause motion sickness, frustration, and can ultimately lead to players leaving your world and not coming back. By optimizing your world, you can ensure that it runs smoothly for all players, regardless of their hardware.

## Identifying Performance Bottlenecks

Before you can fix performance issues, you need to identify them. Meta Horizon Worlds provides a range of tools to help you do this.

*   **Performance Stats:** You can view real-time performance statistics in your world, including frame rate, CPU usage, and GPU usage. This can help you identify if you are CPU-bound or GPU-bound.
*   **Lost Frame Capture:** This tool captures information about any frames that your application drops. This can help you pinpoint the exact moments when performance is suffering.
*   **Collider Visualization:** As mentioned in our "Lighting, Colliders, and Audio" guide, this tool can help you identify any unnecessary or overly complex colliders that may be impacting performance.

## Best Practices for Performance Optimization

### General Principles

*   **Change One Thing at a Time:** When optimizing your world, it's important to change one thing at a time. This will help you to identify which changes are having the biggest impact on performance.
*   **Focus on the Big Wins:** Don't spend time optimizing things that are already fast. Focus on the areas of your world that are causing the biggest performance issues.

### Rendering and Graphics

*   **Reduce Draw Calls:** Every object in your world that is visible to the camera requires a draw call. The more draw calls you have, the more work your GPU has to do. You can reduce draw calls by combining multiple objects into a single object, or by using texture atlases.
*   **Use Optimized Models:** High-polygon models can be a major source of performance issues. Use low-polygon models whenever possible, and use Level of Detail (LOD) to reduce the complexity of models that are far away from the camera.
*   **Limit Dynamic Lighting:** Dynamic lights can be expensive. Use them sparingly, and use static lights whenever possible.

### Physics and Colliders

*   **Use Simple Colliders:** As mentioned in our previous guide, use simple, primitive colliders instead of complex mesh colliders whenever possible.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Colliders:** If an object doesn't need to be collidable, turn its collider off.

### Scripting

*   **Avoid Expensive Operations in `Update()`:** The `Update()` function is called every frame. Avoid running expensive operations in this function, as this can cause your frame rate to drop. Instead, consider running expensive operations less frequently, such as every few seconds or in response to specific events.

By following these best practices, you can create a world that is not only beautiful and engaging, but also performs well for all players. Happy optimizing!
