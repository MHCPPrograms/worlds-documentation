Welcome to the **Lighting Gizmos Tutorial Series**.  
In this course, youâ€™ll learn how to use **static** and **dynamic** light gizmos to enhance your worlds with atmosphere, mood, and interactivity.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
By the end of this tutorial series, you will be able to:
- Understand the difference between **static** and **dynamic** lighting.
- Add, configure, and customize light gizmos in the **Desktop Editor**.
- Use scripting with the **DynamicLightGizmo API** to create interactive effects.

## ðŸ“– What Are Gizmos?
Gizmos are **tools for creators** that represent objects or effects in the world editor.  
Lighting gizmos specifically control how light behaves in your world. They are crucial for:
- Setting the mood and atmosphere.
- Drawing attention to objects.
- Making your world feel more immersive.

## ðŸ’¡ Static vs Dynamic Lights
- **Static Light Gizmos**  
  - Do not change during runtime.  
  - Cheaper performance cost.  
  - Ideal for ambient/background lighting.  

- **Dynamic Light Gizmos**  
  - Can move or change at runtime.  
  - Higher performance cost.  
  - Perfect for flashlights, spotlights, and interactive effects.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
This series is divided into three parts:
1. **Static Light Gizmos** â€” learn to add baked lighting to your scene.  
2. **Dynamic Light Gizmos** â€” create interactive lighting effects.  
3. **Scripting with DynamicLightGizmo API** â€” control lights with code.
